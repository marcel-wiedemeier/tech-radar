<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The CSL Tech Radar is a list of tools, platforms, techniques and languages & frameworks complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:

Our Radar has four rings, which we'll describe starting from the center:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Adopt</strong> ring represents blips that we think you should seriously consider using. We don't say that you should use these for every project; any tool should only be used in an appropriate context. However we do think that a blip in the Adopt ring represents something where there's no doubt that it's proven and mature for use.</li>
<li>The <strong>Trial</strong> ring is for blips that we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. So for most organizations we think you should use these on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit. We've used trial blips in production, but we realize that readers may be more cautious than us.</li>
<li>The <strong>Assess</strong> ring are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet — unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you. Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that we think are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.</li>
<li>The <strong>Hold</strong> ring is for things that, even though they may be accepted in the industry, we haven't had a good experience with. Therefore we are calling them out to warn you that you may run into trouble with them as well. Sometimes it means we think they're irredeemably flawed; or just being misused. We do place things in the Hold ring that we wish the industry wouldn't use.</li>
</ul>

<p>  
We can only put blips into the Trial ring when we have experience of using that blip for production software. This means we sometimes look behind the technology curve, because we may like the look of a technology but haven't yet persuaded a team to try it out — and until we do that, a blip cannot pass into Trial.
For the Adopt ring, we only include items when we think it would be a poor and potentially irresponsible choice not to use them given the appropriate project context.

<h3>What are the quadrants?</h3>
<p>
The quadrants are a categorization of the type of blips:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Techniques</strong> &mdash; These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.</li>
<li><strong>Platforms</strong> &mdash; Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> &mdash; These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions' control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence.</li>
<li><strong>Languages & Frameworks</strong> &mdash; These include programming languages like Java and Python but today primarily focus on frameworks like Gradle, Jetpack, and React.js.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at CSL to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Technology Office</em> &mdash; which facilitates and drives the technology selection discussions at CSL across the Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all Engineering teams at CSL and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br/>

<em>This Tech Radar is built on the open sourced code by <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">Zalando</a> to generate this visualization.</em>
